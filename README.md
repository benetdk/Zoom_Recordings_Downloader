# Zoom Recording Downloader: Setup and Usage Documentation

## 1. Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following:

- **Python 3.x** installed on your machine.
- **pip** installed to manage Python packages.
- A **Zoom OAuth App** set up with the necessary scopes and credentials.
- A **.env** file to securely store your Zoom API credentials.

## 2. Creating and Configuring the Zoom OAuth App

To interact with the Zoom API, you must first create an OAuth app and configure it with the necessary scopes.

### Steps to Create a Zoom OAuth App:
1. **Go to the Zoom Developer Dashboard:**
   - Navigate to [Zoom App Marketplace](https://marketplace.zoom.us/).
   - Log in to your Zoom account.
   - Click on **Develop** > **Build App**.

2. **Create a New OAuth App:**
   - Select **OAuth** from the app types.
   - Fill out the necessary details for your app:
     - **App Name**: Choose a name for your app (e.g., "Zoom Recording Downloader").
     - **App Description**: Provide a brief description of your app (optional).
     - **OAuth Redirect URL**: You can use a localhost URL during development (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`).
     - **Category**: Select the category that best describes your app.

3. **Get Your App Credentials:**
   - Once your app is created, navigate to the **App Credentials** section to retrieve the following details:
     - **Client ID**
     - **Client Secret**
     - **Account ID**

4. **Configure OAuth Scopes:**
   - Under **OAuth Scopes**, add the following scopes:
     - **`account:read`** - Allows the app to access account-level information.
     - **`user:read`** - Provides access to user details within the account.
     - **`meeting:read`** - Access to read meeting details, including recordings.
     - **`recording:read`** - Allows access to recordings for meetings.
     - **`report:read`** (optional) - Provides access to meeting reports.

5. **Save Your App Settings**.

## 3. Setting Up Your Python Script

### Step 1: Install Required Python Packages
Install the necessary Python packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install requests python-dotenv
```

### Step 2: Create a `.env` File for Zoom API Credentials
Create a `.env` file in the same directory as your script. The file will securely store your Zoom credentials:

#### `.env` File Contents:

```plaintext
ZOOM_ACCOUNT_ID=your_zoom_account_id
ZOOM_CLIENT_ID=your_zoom_client_id
ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET=your_zoom_client_secret
```

- Replace `your_zoom_account_id`, `your_zoom_client_id`, and `your_zoom_client_secret` with the credentials obtained from the Zoom Developer Dashboard.

## 4. Running the Script

### Step 1: Download the Script
- Download the Python script from the repository or create it in your own editor using the guidelines provided.

### Step 2: Set Up the `.env` File
- Create a `.env` file in the same directory as the script and insert your Zoom API credentials as described earlier.

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
- Install the required Python packages by running the following command:

```bash
pip install requests python-dotenv
```

### Step 4: Run the Script
Once everything is set up, run the script by executing:

```bash
python zoom_recording_downloader.py
```

### Expected Output:
- The script will download all Zoom recordings from the specified date range into a folder called `zoom_recordings`. The recordings are organized by year, month, and meeting details.

## 5. Troubleshooting

- **Invalid OAuth Token**: Ensure that your OAuth token is valid. If expired, you'll need to regenerate it by authenticating through Zoom's OAuth flow.
- **Scope Errors**: Ensure you have added the correct scopes in your Zoom OAuth app settings as specified in this documentation.
- **Download Errors**: If a download fails, the script will skip that file and continue with the next one.

---

## 6. Notes

### OAuth App Credentials:
- **Client ID**: The unique identifier for your app.
- **Client Secret**: The secret key for authenticating your app.
- **Account ID**: The Zoom account ID tied to the app.

These credentials are stored in the `.env` file to keep them secure. Never commit the `.env` file to any public repository.
